a batch file for swapping between steam beta branches without redownloading. one apon a time i was going to use steamcmd to completely automate this, now this is unnessisary for the game i created it for, and as such, is dead.

to use, you put your game files in the live and ptu folders, then set game branch on steam to the currently selected version (as seen by the file named currently_live or currently_ptu). to swap, just run the batch, set steam beta branch to the branch in question, and play the game - no download needed.

SB has since changed to use a separate steam app id, so this is not needed for starbase. to adapt this for another game, simply modify the directories and optionally the naming of PTU to your choice.
